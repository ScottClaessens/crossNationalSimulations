# Data README file

**Description:** Data files for paper "Controls for non-independence should 
reflect the data-generating process"

**Contact:** Scott Claessens (scott.claessens@gmail.com)

**File format:** RDS files

**Data type and dimensions:** Each file is a 150 x 150 matrix

**File descriptions:**

- *geographic_proximity.rds* - generated by our team, a geographic proximity
matrix that captures the log geodesic distances between population centroids of
150 countries, scaled between 0 and 1, reversed so that higher values indicate
closer proximity

- *linguistic_proximity.rds* - generated by our team, a linguistic proximity
matrix that captures the linguistic distances between 150 countries, using
a patrocladogram of the world's languages to calculate the distances and 
weighted by all languages spoken within countries, scaled between 0 and 1,
higher values indicate stronger connections

- *religious_proximity.rds* - generated by our team, a religious proximity
matrix that captures the religious distances between 150 countries, using
a patrocladogram of the world's religions to calculate the distances and 
weighted by all religions adhered to within countries, scaled between 0 and 1,
higher values indicate stronger connections, contains some missing data

- *religious_proximity_dow.rds* - generated by using the code from
https://osf.io/6nbjc/ which uses information on religious differences from
http://dow.net.au/?page_id=35. A religious proximity matrix that captures the
religious distances between 150 countries based on national-level differences 
in religious affiliations, scaled between 0 and 1, higher values indicate 
stronger connections
